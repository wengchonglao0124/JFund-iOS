# JFund-iOS

This project (JFund), undertaken by a dedicated team, revolves around creating a state-of-the-art mobile payment service application tailored specifically for customers and restaurants. 
As the leader and project manager, I've taken a hands-on approach to ensure a seamless user experience and efficient payment processes.

Our application boasts compatibility with both major mobile operating systems: iOS and Android. Notably, the iOS version is a testament to my individual skills and dedication, 
as I developed it entirely. This versatility ensures a broader reach to our target audience, allowing users across different platforms to enjoy a unified, intuitive experience.

By simplifying and enhancing the dining and payment experience, our goal is to redefine the way customers interact with restaurants in the digital age. Through this endeavour, 
we're not only fostering ease of use but also promoting rapid, secure, and efficient transactions for all parties involved.
